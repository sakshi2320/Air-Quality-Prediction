> This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict AQI levels based on 
environmental factors. Air pollution is a significant public health concern that affects millions of people 
worldwide. The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides a measure of air quality that is easy to 
understand and can inform individual and policy decisions to reduce exposure to air 
pollution

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Linear Regression        | 72.30%   | 
| ExtraTreeReressor        | 89.00%   |
| Random Forest            | 72.30%   |
